VIT Final Year Capstone Project

The goal of the Smart Energy Monitor is to accurately predict the monthly electricity bill of the household using minimum hardware & by acquiring electrical data at a single location (instead of individual sensors per appliance). We do this by analyzing the current & power signatures of all the active devices and pass this information through a Naive Bayes classifier which helps us obtain the Active devices which can further be used to calculate the number of units consumed by individual load appliances.
